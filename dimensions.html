        <!-- put intro -->
        <p>Today we are gonna explore new dimensions merely by some simple and straight examples.</p>
        <hr>
        <!-- put content -->
        <p>What are dimensions? What do we mean by that? How many are there?<br> Well, for starters dimensions are the
            minimum number of points needed to define position of any object. let`s say I want to invite a friend for
            dinner
            at my house, so obviously he will need an address, In Mathematics the address is represented by x, y, z
            (length,width,height) co-ordinates, so that makes three dimensions but wait! I haven`t told my friend what
            time
            he has to come?
            <br> Hence, we need one more the Time dimension. This time dimension was first introduced in General
            relativity
            by Albert Einstein. Unlike the others, the direction of the Time is fixed in our universe i.e. forward.
            <br> Nevertheless, today we are taking an interesting question. Could there be more dimensions?
            Many strongly believe that the answer is yes.
            <br> Let us take a simple example and start our imagination process!
            <br> Imagine you are standing at a distance from a wall. You would see something like in the picture below.
        <div class="image">
            <img src="static/wall.png" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
        </div>



        You only see the height and width of the wall and the not the thickness and you make a conclusion that the wall
        is 2-Dimensional object. From your point, you would think that if an ant were to live on the wall.it would have
        only 2 dimensions in which to walk. The upshot is that from a distance away, a wall appears to be 2 dimensional.
        <!--put image  -->
        In reality, we know that the wall does have a thickness, but by using a pair of binoculars, you can zoom in the
        wall and observe as shown in Fig.
        <div class="image">
            <img src="static/wall2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="..." height="547"
                width="800">
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <!-- put image -->
        You that a little ant on the wall actually has 3 dimensions to walk.
        This example underscores a subtle and important feature of spatial dimensions:
        They come in two varieties. They can be large, extended, and therefore directly manifest, or they can be small,
        curled up and much more difficult to detect.
