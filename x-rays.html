        <p>Characteristics x-rays and Moseley`s law</p>
        <hr>
        <P>Today we are going to talk about a specific part of Electromagnetic spectrum and focus on its characteristics
            and finally how it helped in making the modern periodic table.</P>
        <P>X-ray was discovered by Wilhelm Roentgen. He found that photographic film wrapped in black paper became
            exposed when placed near cathode-ray tube. <br>
            X-rays are produced when highly energetic electrons strike metal then Electromagnetic radiation are produced
            part of which is X-ray with a wavelength of the order of 0.1 nm.
            X-rays are produced by a X-ray tube or Coolidge tube. The diagram is show below. <br><br>
        </P>
        <div class="image">

        </div>
        <br> <br>
        <P>At cathode a filament is used and at anode a metal. The filament is heated electrically so that electrons are
            emitted by thermionic emission. A constant potential difference is maintained between cathode and anode. The
            electrons emitted by filament are, therefore, accelerated by electric filed. Electrons when hit the cathode
            and X-rays are emitted which are brought out of tube by a window. A large amount of heat is developed hence
            a cooling system (running water) is also present there.</P>
        
        <p>Moving forward we will now discuss about characteristic X-Rays and how Henry Moseley`s law of X-ray spectra
            helped in developing modern periodic table.
            Characteristic X-Rays are emitted when an electron knocks out an inner electron of atom with which it
            collides.
        </p>
        <div class="image">

        </div>
        <p>An atom has shells namely K,L,M,N which corresponds to principal quantum number n. Two electrons in K(n=1)
            shell, eight in further shells L(n=2),M(n=3),etc.
            Now when an electron knocks off an inner electron from K shell, a vacancy is created. To fill this a vacancy
            transition of electron takes place from L shell corresponding to which X-rays of photon is emitted of a
            fixed wavelength.
        </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">X-rays emitted due to electronic transition from a higher energy state to vacancy
            created in the K shell are
            called K X-rays.</p>
        <p>If an electron transition takes place from L shell to K shell then it is called K<sub>alpha</sub> X-Ray. Similarly is
            transition takes place from M shell to K shell then it is called K<sub>beta</sub> X-Ray. Same is followed if a vacancy
            is created in L(n=2) shell then L<sub>alpha</sub> X-Ray, L<sub>beta</sub> X-Ray are emitted.</p>
            <br>
        <h3>MOSELEY`S LAW</h3><br>
        <p>Moseley`s experiments played a very important role in developing the modern periodic table. In those days,
            elements were arranged in increasing order of atomic weight consisting many discrepancies.
            Moseley measured the frequency of characteristics X-Rays of many elements and plotted the root of their
            frequency against their position in periodic table. The graph comes to be close to straight line from which
            he concluded that there must be a unique property of an atom which differentiates it from others. Later this
            property was found to be the number of protons or atomic number.

            Moseley`s law can be mathematically expressed as

        <br><br>
        <p>Where a and b are constants ,Moseley`s law can also be derived from Bhor`s atomic model.</p>
